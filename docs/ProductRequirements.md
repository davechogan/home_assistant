# Home Assistant Voice LLM â€“ Product Requirements

## 1. Overview
The goal is to build a voice-based virtual assistant for home automation, leveraging a local LLM (Mixtral) and advanced voice technologies. The assistant should provide a natural, conversational experience, recognize individual users, adapt to their preferences, and continuously improve through feedback.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. Voice Interaction
- **Wake Word Detection**
  - The assistant must remain in a passive listening state and activate only upon hearing a configurable wake word (e.g., "Hey Home").
  - Support for multiple and customizable wake words per user or context.
  - Robustness to background noise and false activations.
- **Speaker Identification**
  - The system must identify the speaker's voice to personalize responses and actions (e.g., user-specific Spotify playlists, lighting preferences).
  - Support for guest mode and temporary profiles with limited permissions.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**
  - Convert spoken commands to text with high accuracy, supporting natural, conversational language.
  - Maintain a voice command history and allow users to review or repeat previous commands by voice.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
  - Respond with a natural, human-like voice, avoiding robotic or synthetic tones.
- **Voice Command History**
  - Let users review or repeat previous commands via voice ("What did I just say?").

### 2.2. Context Awareness
- **Room/Location Inference**
  - Infer the user's current location (e.g., "I am at my desk") and map it to home automation entities (e.g., office lights).
  - Use presence detection (sensors, device signals) to confirm which users are present in a room.
- **Temporal Context**
  - Understand and act on time-based cues ("Turn on the lights at sunset", "Remind me in 10 minutes").
- **Entity Disambiguation**
  - Clarify ambiguous commands by asking follow-up questions (e.g., "Do you also want the master bathroom lights on?").
- **User Preferences**
  - Retrieve and apply user-specific preferences for services (e.g., music, lighting, temperature).
- **Activity Recognition**
  - Infer activities ("I'm going to bed" triggers a bedtime routine).
- **Guest Mode**
  - Temporary profiles for guests, with limited permissions.

### 2.3. Home Automation Integration
- **Device Control**
  - Control smart home devices (lights, thermostats, speakers, etc.) via Home Assistant API.
- **Multi-Entity Actions**
  - Support commands affecting multiple devices or rooms, with context-aware suggestions.
- **Scene and Routine Management**
  - Trigger or create scenes/routines by voice ("Movie night mode").
- **Device Discovery**
  - Automatically detect and announce new devices.
- **Device Status Queries**
  - Ask for device status ("Are the garage doors closed?").
- **Conditional Actions**
  - Support for "if this, then that" logic ("If it's raining, close the windows").

### 2.4. Learning & Adaptation
- **Feedback Loop**
  - Allow users to provide feedback on actions (success/failure, satisfaction).
  - After each command execution, ask for confirmation ("Was this the correct command?")
  - Support yes/no voice responses for quick feedback
  - Log all interactions and feedback for training purposes
- **Model Training**
  - Use LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient model fine-tuning
  - Configurable training settings:
    - Feedback collection frequency
    - Training schedule
    - Minimum feedback threshold
    - Model update criteria
  - Store training data securely with user consent
  - Support for batch training and incremental updates
- **Continuous Improvement**
  - Learn from user corrections and successes to improve future responses and actions.
- **Personalization**
  - Adapt to individual user habits, routines, and preferences over time.
- **Proactive Suggestions**
  - Assistant suggests actions based on patterns ("It's getting dark, should I turn on the porch lights?").
- **Undo/Correction**
  - Allow users to quickly undo or correct actions ("No, I meant the kitchen lights").
- **Learning from Multiple Users**
  - Aggregate learning across users while maintaining privacy.

### 2.5. Conversational Intelligence
- **Clarification & Follow-up**
  - Ask clarifying questions when commands are ambiguous or incomplete.
- **Conversational Memory**
  - Maintain short-term context within a session (e.g., follow-up questions, pronoun resolution).
- **Multi-turn Dialogues**
  - Maintain context over longer conversations ("Turn on the lights. Also, play some music.").
- **Interruptions**
  - Handle interruptions gracefully ("Wait, stop!" or "Actually, never mind").
- **Chit-chat/Small Talk**
  - Support for casual conversation ("How's the weather?").

### 2.6. Security & Privacy
- **Local Processing**
  - All voice and LLM processing should occur locally; no cloud-based voice data transmission.
- **User Data Protection**
  - Securely store and manage user profiles, preferences, and voiceprints.
- **Audit Logs**
  - Maintain logs of actions for transparency and troubleshooting.
- **User Consent Management**
  - Allow users to review and manage what data is stored.
- **Emergency Mode**
  - Special commands for emergencies ("Call for help!").

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**
  - Voice recognition and response should occur with minimal latency (<1 second for most interactions).
  - The system must be extremely performant and reliable, with users never left wondering if it will work.
- **Reliability**
  - System should be robust to network or device failures, with graceful degradation.
  - Fallback mechanisms if the LLM or voice pipeline fails.
- **Extensibility & Modularity**
  - Modular, microservices-friendly architecture to allow easy addition of new devices, services, or skills.
  - Support for custom skills/plugins and APIs for third-party integrations.
- **Usability**
  - Simple onboarding for new users (voiceprint registration, preference setup).
- **Accessibility**
  - Support for users with different accents, speech patterns, or disabilities.
- **Offline Operation**
  - Ensure core features work without internet.
- **Energy Efficiency**
  - Optimize for low power usage on always-on devices.
- **Multi-platform Support**
  - Run on various hardware (Raspberry Pi, NUC, etc.).

## 4. Stretch Goals / Future Enhancements
- **Multi-language Support**
  - Support for multiple languages and dialects.
- **Mobile App Integration**
  - Companion app for remote control and notifications.
- **Advanced Routines**
  - Learn and suggest routines based on user behavior.
- **Visual Feedback**
  - Optional UI for visual status, logs, and manual overrides.
- **Integration with Wearables**
  - Use smartwatches for presence or quick commands.
- **Remote Access**
  - Securely control home when away.
- **Third-party Service Integration**
  - Weather, news, calendar, etc.
- **Child Safety Mode**
  - Restrict certain actions for child users.

## 5. Open Questions / To Be Defined
- What is the preferred wake word?
- How will the system handle multiple users in the same room?
- What are the privacy requirements for storing and processing voiceprints?
- Should the assistant support remote (outside home) commands?
- What is the minimum hardware required for local LLM and voice processing?
- How will updates and new features be delivered?
- What is the fallback if the LLM or voice pipeline fails?
- How will the system handle conflicting commands from multiple users?

## 6. Next Steps
- Review and refine requirements with stakeholders.
- Prioritize features for MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
- Define technical architecture and integration points.
- Begin prototyping core voice pipeline and backend.
